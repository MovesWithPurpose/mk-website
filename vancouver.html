<h2>Spontaneous Weekend in Vancouver - April 11, 2025</h2>
<p>Kayla and I had always tossed around the idea of heading north to Vancouver ever since we moved to Washington. My dad kept saying we needed to see it. One Friday around noon, just a day after our four-year anniversary, we looked at each other and said, “Let’s just go.” So we packed a bag, hopped in the car, and hit the road — no hotel booked, no real plan.</p>
<p>We booked a room on the way up and arrived in downtown Vancouver after a roughly four-hour drive. As soon as we entered the city, we were blown away. The skyline, the greenery, the vibe — it felt fresh but historic, like everything had a story but was still alive. We unpacked and walked right into downtown where we stumbled upon a great spot for dinner, the Cactus Club Cafe, and celebrated belatedly.</p>
<p>We explored the city on foot and bike. We crossed the Capilano Suspension Bridge (Kayla’s least favorite wobbly thing), cruised around Stanley Park, and passed under the towering Lion’s Gate Bridge. The cherry blossoms were in bloom too — a total surprise bonus, especially for Kayla who absolutely lights up around them. We also strolled along the pier and just soaked it all in.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a trip packed with plans — just a spontaneous adventure with each other. We’re incredibly thankful for the freedom to travel like this and to experience such beautiful places side by side. These are the memories we’ll look back on with full hearts.</p>
